CI/CD Pipeline for Sample Application
This repository contains a CI/CD pipeline configuration for automating the build, testing, and deployment process of a sample application using GitLab CI/CD. The pipeline is designed to streamline the development workflow and ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using popular tools like GitLab CI/CD. The pipeline automates various stages of the software development lifecycle, including building the application, running tests, and deploying it to a production server.

Pipeline Configuration
The CI/CD pipeline is configured using the .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of this repository. The file defines three stages: build, test, and deploy. Each stage has a corresponding script that executes the necessary commands.

Build Stage: This stage is responsible for building the application. It installs the required dependencies and executes the build script specific to your application.

Test Stage: This stage runs the tests for your application. It ensures that the application behaves as expected and meets the defined criteria.

Deploy Stage: The deploy stage handles the deployment of the application. It executes the necessary commands to deploy the application to a production server. You can customize this stage based on your specific deployment requirements.

Getting Started
To use this CI/CD pipeline for your own application, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Update the .gitlab-ci.yml file with the necessary build, test, and deployment commands specific to your application.
Commit the changes and push them to your own Git repository.
Configure GitLab CI/CD in your GitLab repository to enable the pipeline.
Push any changes to your application's code to trigger the pipeline.
The CI/CD pipeline will automatically execute the defined stages whenever changes are pushed to your repository. It will build the application, run tests, and deploy it based on the configuration you provided.
